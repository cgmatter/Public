# <center><u>CameraTracker Errors</u></center>

All errors are a result of:

1. An issue with the footage.
2. An issue with installation/use.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è <u>Error Message ‚â† Cause of Error</u>

Almost always your error message will say:

>RuntimeError: Error: Python: Traceback
 
or

>Can't find scene_dense.ply

Note that any issue in feature extraction, matching, solving, densifying will eventually *result in these same final errors messages*.

So really:

>RuntimeError: Error: Python: Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/Blender/4.5/extensions/user_default/camera_tracker_macos/__init__.py", line 569, in invoke
 return self.execute(context)

**tells us absolutely nothing**. The problem is usually more subtle. That's why the **FULL LOG** is much more useful.

## üéûÔ∏è <u>Footage Issues</u>

Generally, **bad footage = bad solve**.

### <center>The *best Solution is always to film again!*</center>

**CameraTracker** uses [photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry) under the hood, so the same principles apply. Here are the common pitfalls:

- <span style="color:orange">**Prominant Moving Objects**</span> - person in the foreground, cars, leaves and grass rustling.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: mask out these subjects.</span>
- <span style="color:orange">**Large Reflective Objects**</span> - windows, shiny floors, metal.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: mask out these reflections.</span>
- <span style="color:orange">**Zero Parallax**</span> - tripod shots, no movement, very distant scenery.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: Film with at least some [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax) - try the *insane mode* matcher.</span>
- <span style="color:orange">**Large Featureless Surfaces**</span> - blank walls, greenscreens, plain backgrounds.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: Try increasing *features to 8000* and *overlap to 30*.</span>
- <span style="color:orange">**Low Quality Footage**</span> - motion blur, heavy grain, low resolution.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: Capture better footage.</span>
- <span style="color:orange">**Dramatic lighting changes**</span> - lens flares, indoor-to-outdoor, fast moving lights.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: Mask out lens flares - film on manual settings (no autoexposure).</span>

You'll find that fixing these issues will almost always fix your solve.

## ‚öôÔ∏è <u>Installation/Use Issues</u>

Go to the [product page](https://superhivemarket.com/products/camera-tracker) for compatibility and installation instructions. Here are the most common issues:

- <span style="color:orange">**Sequence In Wrong Drive**</span> - footage on D:/, external SSD, cloud drives.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: Put the sequence on the same drive as Blender (usually C:/).
- <span style="color:orange">**Unconventional Filepaths**</span> - exotic characters (√®,√©,√™,√´), spaces, non-english characters.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: Fix your filepath to avoid these cases.
- <span style="color:orange">**Wrong Sequence Names**</span> - 1.jpg, image1.png, frame_1.tiff.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: Image sequences should always follow the convention name_0001.png, name_0002.png, etc. (can be other image formats and any name).

- <span style="color:orange">**Wrong OS**</span> - installing MacOS on Windows - installing Windows on MacOS.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: Uninstall the addon, download the compatible version and reinstall.
- <span style="color:orange">**Blender Compatibility**</span> - Blender not from [Blender.org](https://www.blender.org), old versions, portable versions.
    - <span style="color:lightgreen">Solution: Only use non-portable Blender 4.3+ official builds (no Microsoft Store, etc.).
